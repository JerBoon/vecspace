\title{Find the distance at which a ray first intersects with an object, plus any relevant object
properties at the point of intersection}
\usage{
Spc.Intersect(ray.origin, ray.direction, object)
}
\arguments{
\item{ray.origin}{A positional vector of where the ray originates}

\item{ray.direction}{A directional vector for the ray's direction}

\item{object}{The object (elementary or compound) we're testing for intersection}
}
\value{
A list of intersect properties, consisting of:
   distance = intersect distance (as proportin of the length of ray.direction);
   normal = the surafce normal at the point of intersect. FOr the sake of efficiecy this will be of arbitrary length;
   properties = the *properties* attribute from the intersected object (or NA if none);
   north, east = where applicable, a pair of values representing the point of inetrsection from the object's perspective
}
\description{

properties at the point of intersection
